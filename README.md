## rescript-json

This package helps you convert between Rescript values and JSON values.

### API Docs

See the API docs for installation/usage [here](https://rescript-json.jaredramirez.omg.lol/)!

### Credit

This package is a port of [Elm's JSON decoding library](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/).

When creating this package, I basically went through the docs for the Elm library and implemented a Rescript version. Additional, because it's so well done, the documentation is copied verbatim.

Thanks to Evan Czaplicki ([@evancz](https://github.com/evancz)) and all other folks for designing and creating the excellent Elm package!
